## What is Monty Hall problem in text? 
Assume that a room is equipped with three doors. Behind two are goats, and behind the third is a shiny new car. You are asked to pick a door, and will win whatever is behind it. Let's say you pick door 1. Before the door is opened, however, someone who knows what's behind the doors (Monty Hall) opens one of the other two doors, revealing a goat, and asks you if you wish to change your selection to the third door (i.e., the door which neither you picked nor he opened). The Monty Hall problem is deciding whether you do. 


### So, let’s get started!!! 
First, we need to make a vector “doors” with three doors: “A”, “B” and “C”.
```
doors <- c("A", "B" , "C")
```
Then, we need to create an object into which we store all the information that is generated by the loop.

### Results
That’s it! 
The length of the switching should be approaching 666 in a series of 1,000 simulations. The more simulations you do (try 10,000!), the more you will approach a ratio of 2/3 for the switching case and 1/3 for the no-switching case. We proved Marilyn vos Savant right, switching is better!! Yay!!
